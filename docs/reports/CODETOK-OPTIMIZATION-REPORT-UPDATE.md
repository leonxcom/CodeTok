# CodeTok Project Optimization Report - Update

## Recently Discovered and Fixed Issues

### 1. Database Access Layer Type Errors
In our previous optimization, we improved the database access layer implementation by transforming `db` from a callable template tag function to an object with multiple methods. However, this caused type errors in several API route files, as they were still attempting to use template string syntax to call the `db` object.

#### Problem Locations:
- src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts
- src/app/api/projects/random/route.ts
- src/app/api/projects/recommend/route.ts

#### Error Message:
```
This expression is not callable. Type '{ query(text: string, params?: any[]): Promise<QueryResult<any>>; transaction<T>(callback: (client: any) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>; sql: VercelPool & (<O extends QueryResultRow>(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: Primitive[]) => Promise<...>); }' has no call signatures.
```

#### Solution:
We modified all affected files, replacing direct `db` template string calls with the imported `sql` function:

```typescript
// Before:
const result = await db`
  SELECT * FROM projects 
  WHERE id = ${id}
`;

// After:
const result = await sql`
  SELECT * FROM projects 
  WHERE id = ${id}
`;
```

This resolved all type errors, ensuring database queries align with our refactored database access layer.

### 2. Further Optimization Notes

We conducted a comprehensive review of database connection and query handling, ensuring all code accessing the PostgreSQL database follows a consistent pattern, using the correct imports and calling methods.

All code now passes type checking and lint checking with no errors or warnings.

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Standardize Database Access**: Consider creating a more structured database access layer, such as a repository pattern, to reduce duplicated code and provide more consistent error handling

2. **Add Transaction Support**: For operations requiring multiple queries, such as user registration or project creation, leverage our added `db.transaction` method to ensure atomicity

3. **Add Query Logging and Monitoring**: Consider enhancing database query logging, including query time statistics and performance analysis, to identify and optimize slow queries

4. **Extend Caching Strategy**: Continue expanding API caching strategies, adding appropriate caching for high-frequency access content that doesn't change frequently
